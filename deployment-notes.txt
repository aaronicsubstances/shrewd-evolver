# big ideas for alleviating pain of server management

-Ideally, Platform as a Service - e.g. Heroku. Takes away almost entire server administration tasks!

-Else Infrastructure as a Service - e.g. AWS. Provides virtual machines, and hence takes away hardware 
 and even operating system maintenance.
 -use Nagios or Zabbix in the beginning while app count is low, together with lots of bash scripting
 -ultimately employ commercial network monitoring solutions like SolarWinds

-avoid being taken hostage by server administrators (due to use of uncommon server admin knowledge) by 
 -preferring traditional OS concepts of file system, multiprocessing and tcp/udp networking to containers,
  while container orchestration technology (e.g. Kubernetes) continue to expound complex and unstandardized
  terminology
 -exploring user accounts per app deployment on IaaS or bare metal
 -making automated server admin operations equivalent to manual intervention via ssh

# bare metal server admin tasks

Software management tasks applicable to OS, shrinkwrap apps, and bespoke apps
-deploy/install and undeploy/uninstall
-start/open and stop/close
-upgrades
-metrics and logs monitoring
-testing
-defining background services on startup and cron (task scheduler on windows) jobs
 -http, ftp, smtp, ssh, ntp
-Active Directory
-using apps, e.g. remote desktop, ssh, creating folders and files, creating sql tables, 
 running bulk sql inserts, executing bash scripts, compressing logs, downloading files,
 sending emails

Hardware Management Tasks
-Disk backup
-Disk cleanup
-RAID configuration
-Power backup
-Hardware upgrades
-Network configuration
-prevent clock drift with NTP
-GPU configuration for CPU-bound tasks?

Security Tasks
-User management and authorization
-TLS certificate management
-Firewall configuration
-testing for security vulnerabilities
-Antivirus

Build Automation Tasks
-continuous integration
-continuous delivery

Availability
-accept limitation that it can only be done via DNS (virtual domain) or ARP (virtual IP)
 (http://tenereillo.com/GSLBPageOfShame.htm)
 
Scaling
-for manual horizontal scalability, make use of spare capacity and multiple ips per domain
