order by test name: 
use partial classes with ITC_AAE_ prefix, AAE, AAJ, AAO, AAT, AAY up to ZZY for 3000+ test classes increase in steps of 5
use Test_AAA_0000_ prefix, 0000 to 9990 increase in steps of 10 for 1000 test cases per class
let declarations be sorted

create skip exception and wrapper method for test cases


add tree data matcher and anonymous types (better than FluentAssertions which requires class libraries)

store temporary state with service locator pattern and per assembly or per class hooks/scopes.
use constructor/dispose pattern to create global and local variable context
