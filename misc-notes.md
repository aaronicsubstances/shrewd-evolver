What happens with the passage of time after first release: e.g. as requests per second from outside world (humans and systems), data storage volumes, bug fix requests and feature requests from stakeholders increase without bound?
1. difficulty in changing architecture of code and of data
2. difficulty in radically changing interface to outside world (e.g. GUI and APIs),
3. dependency of maintenance on ease of software life cycle steps after coding, i.e. testing, integration, deployment, monitoring, debugging.
4. need for deployed software to be capable of being replicated on development machines, for ease of debugging 
5. need of software to satisfy future stakeholders, esp maintainers
6. importance of human and time factors, identifying time context of every data item, seeking and streaming, and distributed systems in scaling data
7. need to apply security fixes to deployed technologies,
8. need to deal with changes to deployed technologies (e.g. OS versions, library versions),
9. changes in the technologies in vogue. Discipline required not to change old code that works.
10. need for data security, including possibility of barring access to programmer or DBA
11. need to record input requests from external world (after redaction), to cater for unforeseen aspect of data architecture such as analytics.
12. need to foresee code architecutre as a precursor to a distributed system
