# Discoverable database schema
-DB vendor independent way to specify relationships (cardinality, ordinality at each end)
-foreign keys?
-constraints (the C in ACID). Defining primitives to use - pure functional expressions to apply to subset of records in all tables.
-probably think of something like running checks and tests on database readonly view (snapshot isolation sort of)

GREAT! Let discoverable database schema take the form of tests on database. Hopefully, because they are tests, future maintainers can read and understand.

# Discoverable software architecture based on network connections

-Log network connections and run checks and tests on them to assert some architectural constraints on which subsystems can talk to who.
-Also useful could be discovering subsystem connectivity or network from network connection log
